# Personal
This is my personal website, built with HTML, CSS and simple JavaScript (at the moment static and without backend functionalitiy yet).
Here you can be informed about me as a self-taught web developer who is looking for a junior or trainee position.

I implemented following themes and functionalities:
- Fixed nav bar
- Hero page
- Bootstrap for collapse
- Javascript for toggle
- Icons from Font Awesome
- Form page
